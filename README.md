# gfan-install-mac-os

A simple script to install [gfan](https://users-math.au.dk/jensen/software/gfan/gfan.html) by Anders Jensen easily on Mac OS Tahoe 26.2 from source.
Should automate downloading dependencies and running the various build steps, as well as making some minor tweaks to make the code compile against gcc-15 and so forth (possibly unnecessary, but I had to do so to get it working).

The only dependency is that you should have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) already (and you should be running this without Rosetta emulation)!
